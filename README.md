This is a web-frontend for **PAL**.

For this frontend to work, you will need an installation of PAL first.
You can get it from https://github.com/johannessimon/pal .

Here's how to get it running:

```bash
mkdir pal-installation && cd pal-installation
git clone https://github.com/johannessimon/pal.git
git clone https://github.com/johannessimon/pal-server.git
cd pal && mvn install -DskipTests
cd ../pal-server && mvn package -DskipTests
export WNHOME=/path/to/wordnet/3.1/
cp target/pal-server.war /path/to/webapps
```

Then start your web server if you havenâ€™t already done so, or restart if it does not support
hot-deployment of the war file. To read logging output generated by PAL, e.g. for troubleshooting,
you may specify log4j configuration file by adding **-Dlog4j.configuration=/path/to/file** to the
Java VM arguments.

Also, you will need to specify the configuration directory of PAL containing the sparql_endpoints/
directory using **-Dconfig.home=$PWD/src/main/resources/** while you are in the git-server checkout
directory.
